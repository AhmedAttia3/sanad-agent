# Operations & Automation Map of Contents (MOC)

This directory owns the specifications of deployment structures, CI/CD pipelines, Docker runbooks, and n8n background workflow schemas.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Separation Rule:**
> - **No Coding Contracts:** Coding rules and subdirectory constraints reside exclusively inside `<subproject>/AGENTS.md` files.
> - **No Action Commands:** Terminal execution and testing commands reside exclusively inside `.agent/skills/` files.
> - This folder must strictly contain static deployment runbooks, server orchestration layouts, and webhook mapping charts.
